Texas State Signup
==================

This is [Texas State University's](http://txstate.edu) instance of the 
[Signup Reservation System](https://github.com/txstate-etc/txst-signup).

See it live at http://signup.txstate.edu.
=======
Signup
=========

The Signup tool allows users to signup for a workshop, presentation, meeting, or any other event requiring a reservation. Users will be sent automatic reminders about the event and allowed to cancel their reservation if needed.

Events in Signup can also contain a maximum participant limit. If the limit is reached users are automatically added to a waiting list. If an already confirmed user cancels the reservation, the people on the waiting list are confirmed as participants and sent a notification.

This application was generated with the [rails_apps_composer](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer) gem
provided by the [RailsApps Project](http://railsapps.github.io/).

Project code base changes
--------
* Till [commit 1937f6014c48](https://github.com/txstate-etc/txst-signup/commit/1937f6014c4808ff7509e3de610357c2d3dbb35a), this txst-signup is depend on [signup gem source code ](https://github.com/txstate-etc/signup/commit/0b87344243abeacdbb011ce1ff1c805ea18eadf5) (as signup engine) which was also developed by Texas State University as an open source contribution).

* Start from [commit 75d8048af8ed66](https://github.com/txstate-etc/txst-signup/commit/75d8048af8ed66e35dc770b37cb398e3c2a8d7f8), we combined signup from [commit 0b87344243 ](https://github.com/txstate-etc/signup/commit/0b87344243abeacdbb011ce1ff1c805ea18eadf5) with txst-sign into one place, therefore, original signup engine might no longer in need or most likely no longer get maintained after [commit 0b87344243 ](https://github.com/txstate-etc/signup/commit/0b87344243abeacdbb011ce1ff1c805ea18eadf5).

* The work of consolidating txst-signup with signup is done in [consolidate-signup branch](https://github.com/txstate-etc/txst-signup/tree/consolidate-signup)
